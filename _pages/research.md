## Works in Progress

**Judge Influence and Judicial Network**
>I study the extent to which judges' influence depend on the judges' social connections. Guided by a theoretical model that formalizes the role of social connection, I document that social connections are a significant determinant of judge influence. I use the flow of law clerks between judges from 1995-2004 as a measure of social connections, total citations as a proxy for influence, and I address network endogeneity by using novel data on the judges' alumni connections. Our results also provide new insights into how social connectedness interacts with judge demographic characteristics.

>We review the concept of Monte Carlo test as a simulation-based inference procedure which allows one to construct tests with provably exact levels in situations where the distribution of a test statistic is difficult to establish but can be simulated. The number of simulations required can be extremely small, as low as 19 to run a test with level 0.05. We discuss three extensions of the method: (1) a randomized tie-breaking technique which allows one to use test statistics with discrete null distributions, without further information on the mass points; (2) an extension (maximized Monte Carlo tests) which yields provably valid tests when the test statistic depends on a (finite) number of nuisance parameters; (3) an asymptotic version which allows one to get asymptotically valid tests without any need to establish an asymptotic distribution. As the method is computer intensive, we describe an R package (MaxMC) that allows one to implement this type of procedure. A number of special cases and applications are discussed.

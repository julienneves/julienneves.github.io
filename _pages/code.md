with Jean-Marie Dufour
_R package_
>An implementation of the Monte Carlo techniques described in details by Dufour (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2005.06.007> and Dufour and Khalaf (2007) <doi:10.1002/9780470996249.ch24>. The two main features available are the Monte Carlo method with tie-breaker, mc(), for discrete statistics, and the Maximized Monte Carlo, mmc(), for statistics with nuisance parameters.

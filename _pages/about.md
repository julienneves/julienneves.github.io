I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics at Cornell University](http://economics.cornell.edu/), working under the supervision of [Christopher Huckfeldt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/), [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/), and [Karel Mertens](https://karelmertens.com/).

My research interests are macroeconomics, household consumption, and housing economics.  My job market paper studies the distributional consequences of household leverage regulations implemented after the Great Recession.

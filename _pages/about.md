I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Cornell University](http://economics.cornell.edu/) under the supervision of [Christopher Huckfeldt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/) (co-chair), [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/) (co-chair), and [Karel Mertens](https://karelmertens.com/).

I will be joining the [Department of Economics at Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ/) as an Assistant Professor in August 2019.

My research interests are macroeconomics, household consumption, and housing economics.  My [job market paper](https://malin-hu.github.io/files/MH_JMP.pdf) studies the aggregate and distributional consequences of household leverage regulations implemented after the Great Recession.

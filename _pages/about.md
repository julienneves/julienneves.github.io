I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at [Vanderbilt Unviersity](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ).  I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Cornell University](http://economics.cornell.edu) under the supervision of [Christopher Huckfeldt](https://huckfeldt.economics.cornell.edu/) (co-chair), [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/) (co-chair), and [Karel Mertens](https://karelmertens.com/) in May 2019.

My research interests are macroeconomics, household consumption, and housing economics.  My [job market paper](https://malin-hu.github.io/files/MH_JMP.pdf) studies the aggregate and distributional consequences of household leverage regulations implemented after the Great Recession.
